            <p><b>Information: </b> We are a small local apiary here in Ankeny with huge growth potential.  
We current operate just 35 bee hives in the area, but are looking to increase that number dramatically.  We are also going to be working with Iowa State University starting in November on a 2 year research project looking at bee nutrition and Prarie Strip land on area farms.
My background is in Engineering and Management, so I could use some help in advertising and marketing assistance.  This would include solutions for marketing/sales of honey, beeswax, candles, gaining exposure to group speeches/presentaions, farmers markets, etc.
I am looking forward to meeting you all and even giving you a tour of the bees (weather permitting).
If you have any questions, please let me know.
Thanks
Dean Coleman
