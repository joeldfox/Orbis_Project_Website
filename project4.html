            <p><b>Information: </b> I would like students to make short videos to inform workers and employees about specific tools including safety and effective usage on construction sites. 
I would also like students to make short videos to inform workers and employees about OSHA safety videos instead of continuing to use boring paper and pencil. 
</p>
            <p><b>Purpose:</b> As a marketing project, I would like Orbis students to think of new ways to potentially market to professionals interested in the Leadership Program or to get them interested in the program.
