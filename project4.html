            <p><b>Information: </b> WordPress from Grundmeyer Leader Services is a website built to hire leaders in the workforce and world of professionals. I am busy with other projects at the moment, so I have not finished the website. However, I would like to get the site to a point where I can sell it to another company or organization that can use it, instead of just letting it slip through the cracks.
</p>
            <p><b>Purpose:</b> I would like students to market this project and figure out a way to either finish the website so it is ready for other companies to buy or take over.
