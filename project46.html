            <p><b>Information: </b> Ankeny school district data from 2019 shows there is a significant difference in pass rates (scoring 3 or higher) between female and male students who take AP exams. Since it has been shown that intellectual abilities are not unique to a gender it is important to understand why the pass rate is lower for female students. Is this issue specific to one school year or is it a bigger trend? Is data available across multiple years? If so, what does it show? If it is more than one year what could be contributing factors to the difference? Are females receiving different instruction? Are females taking more difficult subjects? Are fewer females taking the AP exams? Could there be other factors at play? 
In addition to myself, Jake Kerber would be a good advisor on this project to provide an additional lens.
