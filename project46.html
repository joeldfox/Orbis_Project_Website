            <p><b>Information: </b> - project around affordable housing: Ankeny has a very high rental market. Many people we work with struggle to pay the high cost of living. 
- elderly population and helping them with simple tasks. We are exploring the possibility of developing a program that address this issue. It would be a huge undertaking, so we would appreciate any insight into the issue, so we can figure out how best to address this situation. We have been seeing more and more of this scenario recently. 
- lack of public transportation in Ankeny: Getting an Uber, Lyft or taxi in Ankeny is next to impossible. DART is pretty unreliable and what is offered isn't very convenient for many people. The paid services cost too much for low income people to afford. 
- local food sources/food rescue. So many pantries are struggling with purchasing food. Inflation has really impacted the budgets of small non profits. A secondary issue, is a majority of pantries order from the Food Bank of Iowa. The problem becomes that every pantry has identical items. We are working really hard to make our pantry different than the others. We are focusing on healthy options, with extra emphasis on meat, dairy and produce.  We aim to become a more specialty pantry and offer oils, spices and other things that typical pantries don't stock.
As far as food rescue, we would love to explore more partnerships. Companies lose so much money discarding spoiled food. We have three pantries at The Center. Our two regulated pantries serve almost 800 individuals a month. Our anytime pantry serves anywhere from 30-40 people per day! We have the volunteers, and the ability to pick up, and we have the client load to have the food leave prior to any spoilage. Any food we may have that would go bad over the weekend, when we're closed, is picked up and taken to the homeless shelters and homeless camps in the area. We tend to struggle as potential donors dislike the idea of giving product away. However, what they're missing, is the fact that they lose out on profit by throwing it away, and it increases their cost due to paying the dumpster and trash fees. By working together, it is beneficial to all involved. We have the opportunity to buy at a discounted price, or to process part or all of the donation as a tax write off. We would love to work together to remove that cost, rescue the wasted food, and better serve our community.
- Abundance of technology and apps --- could they be streamlined. (Eat Greater DSM concept). We do have a lot of ideas on how to create an app that does everything we need to! Specifically to connect with clients and volunteers.
- Year Round Fresh Produce/Herbs/"Gather" in Omaha. With food insecurity being such an issue, one idea we had was inside hydroponic gardens. Gather in Omaha is the inspiration. I do have pictures of their set up if that is of any help. If we could make and distribute our own produce, we would really stand apart from the other pantries, and it would greatly help our food budget, while giving our clients the most fresh selection of lettuce, produce and herbs.
