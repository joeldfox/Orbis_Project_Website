            <p><b>Information: </b> I would like some help in making the garden club a more sustainable club that would have an impact on community.  We have some things  -asparagus and rhubarb purchased for the garden that will need to be planted and maintained as well as a diverse native prairie mix to be planted around the garden late this fall - so the ground will need to be prepared to be planted.  We have many more ideas - we just need help. We would have multiple deadlines - asparagus and rhubarb will arrive late April  - so that would be the first deadline.  Otherwise this is could be a long term project.
</p>
            <p><b>Purpose:</b> 5/14/2022
