            <p><b>Information: </b> On With Life sent out more than 130 e-newsletters through Constant Contact last year. This year, with the addition of our new education offering, On With Life Academy, we anticipate it to be closer to 175. We are looking for assistance in creating templates in Constant Contact for the different types of newsletters we send out. This would include, but is not limited to, virtual fitness classes, education events, general e-newsletters, foundation, etc. 
</p>
            <p><b>Purpose:</b> This is a market outside of our niche, that we would love to be able to serve more often.
