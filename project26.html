            <p><b>Information: </b> (Per JF) Ruan is a nationwide trucking and logistics company. They have over 250 nationwide technicians and are looking to expand and upgrade their existing progrmas. They are also opening a new shop off of Corporate Woods drive.
</p>
            <p><b>Purpose:</b> There is no organization, but I would say If we can instill these skills and habits into young kids, by the time they are in highschool showing meaningfull gratitude will be second nature to them. It will not be scary, confusing, or hard for them. This will benefit our whole community.
