            <p><b>Information: </b> We would like a team of innovators to help us improve the Orbis website to help us tell our story so that we can make a bigger impact on our community and meet the needs of those who might access it (students, parents, workforce).
</p>
            <p><b>Purpose:</b> More effectively telling our story will help us connect more with organizations in our community which will hopefully lead to more opportunities to partner with a wider variety of organizations and make the biggest impact we possibly can.  This would also allow us to have a wide variety of project opportunities for innovators to choose from.
It will also help us recruit and promote to future innovators and their parents.
