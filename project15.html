            <p><b>Information: </b> Something like..... a continuation of the launch project but focused on a different demographic (lower socioeconomic status maybe) and possibly partnering with organizations like: Boys & Girls Club, Sisters 4 Success, Brother 2 Brother.  
</p>
            <p><b>Purpose:</b> More effectively telling our story will help us connect more with organizations in our community which will hopefully lead to more opportunities to partner with a wider variety of organizations and make the biggest impact we possibly can.  This would also allow us to have a wide variety of project opportunities for innovators to choose from.
It will also help us recruit and promote to future innovators and their parents.
