            <p><b>Information: </b> Special Events:  Our Orbis team is interested in tapping into Innovators' expertise in designing special events that would occur annually.  We'd like to build out a framework for each event so we could build upon it each year.  Examples include an annual Orbis alumni event, a project provider celebration, an open house during football season (perhaps on the evening of the AHS/CHS game), and any other ideas you have.
</p>
            <p><b>Purpose:</b> This will spread the Orbis love!  :)  We are always seeking ways to celebrate the work of our business partners and students, as well as market for additional partners and students.
