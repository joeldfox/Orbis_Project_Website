I'm also looking for some student creativity in proposing ideas we have not thought of yet.

We want to get information from students, past and present (if possible) on how we best can do this as an organization. We would like students to develop something similar in terms of how they would best drive or lead a career presentation that would engage them and their peers. This could be a mock presentation, a flyer, etc.
We have provided below some sample questions to drive the conversation and project and provide a basis for the direction. 
1) How should we best engage students (format, timing, resources we provide, etc.)
2) What information would you find to be most helpful that companies could provide
3) What questions need to be answered but never seem to be answered at career fairs or during presentations
4) How do you find out about careers? (social media, friends, word of mouth)

</h2>
                <p>Hugs for Whoever was began during onboarding of second semester of the 2020/2021 school year. We had a project to basically increase gratitude in the community. We narrowed that down to highschoolers showing gratitude to outsiders in there lives (strangers or acquaintances, although this would subsequently be helpful toward close friends/family aswell). We then did some learning (see link(s) below) and tried to come up with solutions, but realized the true need is that highschoolers do not have the skills or habits to show true meaningful gratitude often. That brought us to HMW create a system or incentive for elementary school kids to increase meaningful gratitude? However, that is a longer project and we wanted to move on so we did some prototyping and just applied it to our Orbis block. The "Menu of Activities Doc" with the provided link has the prototyping information that we did.
