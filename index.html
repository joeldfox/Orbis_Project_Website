Recently, Ankeny schools has updated it's mission statement and portrait of a graduate. These are potential things that could be incorporated into this idea along with building specific information (the Jag creed, Centennial logos, etc.) and/or examples of student work/projects (student art, etc.)

How do we reach individuals currently working elsewhere to try and recruit those that are happy with their current employer?  What technology should we be using to get in front of potential applicants? What would you change about our website?

How do we "catch the eye" of these young women so that they know we're here to help?  How do we do that without spending money.  Simple things.

              <h2>Ankeny Service Center
</h2>
                <p>- project around affordable housing: Ankeny has a very high rental market. Many people we work with struggle to pay the high cost of living. 
- elderly population and helping them with simple tasks. We are exploring the possibility of developing a program that address this issue. It would be a huge undertaking, so we would appreciate any insight into the issue, so we can figure out how best to address this situation. We have been seeing more and more of this scenario recently. 
- lack of public transportation in Ankeny: Getting an Uber, Lyft or taxi in Ankeny is next to impossible. DART is pretty unreliable and what is offered isn't very convenient for many people. The paid services cost too much for low income people to afford. 
- local food sources/food rescue. So many pantries are struggling with purchasing food. Inflation has really impacted the budgets of small non profits. A secondary issue, is a majority of pantries order from the Food Bank of Iowa. The problem becomes that every pantry has identical items. We are working really hard to make our pantry different than the others. We are focusing on healthy options, with extra emphasis on meat, dairy and produce.  We aim to become a more specialty pantry and offer oils, spices and other things that typical pantries don't stock.
As far as food rescue, we would love to explore more partnerships. Companies lose so much money discarding spoiled food. We have three pantries at The Center. Our two regulated pantries serve almost 800 individuals a month. Our anytime pantry serves anywhere from 30-40 people per day! We have the volunteers, and the ability to pick up, and we have the client load to have the food leave prior to any spoilage. Any food we may have that would go bad over the weekend, when we're closed, is picked up and taken to the homeless shelters and homeless camps in the area. We tend to struggle as potential donors dislike the idea of giving product away. However, what they're missing, is the fact that they lose out on profit by throwing it away, and it increases their cost due to paying the dumpster and trash fees. By working together, it is beneficial to all involved. We have the opportunity to buy at a discounted price, or to process part or all of the donation as a tax write off. We would love to work together to remove that cost, rescue the wasted food, and better serve our community.
- Abundance of technology and apps --- could they be streamlined. (Eat Greater DSM concept). We do have a lot of ideas on how to create an app that does everything we need to! Specifically to connect with clients and volunteers.
- Year Round Fresh Produce/Herbs/"Gather" in Omaha. With food insecurity being such an issue, one idea we had was inside hydroponic gardens. Gather in Omaha is the inspiration. I do have pictures of their set up if that is of any help. If we could make and distribute our own produce, we would really stand apart from the other pantries, and it would greatly help our food budget, while giving our clients the most fresh selection of lettuce, produce and herbs.

</h2>
                <p>We have been selected to participate in a national agroforestry research program, designed to expand  perennial food production with chestnut trees. Students will partner in research with Auburn University, U of Missouri and Notre Dame.  Last year ORBIS  STEM Team harvested scion branch tips from individual trees  for genetic phenotype classification. 
We now have some nut production, and we would like to invite students to help harvest some nuts to send in to identify genetic crossing. The universities will them germinate nuts to expand production zones.  Our farm is the northern most producer in this research. The students collaboration work manual  will be sent to the universities

We would like Orbis's input on what this looks like, research companies that might host internships, and develop a way to organize and promote these opportunities to students. This may include creating videos to market summer internships.

                <p>I'd like to think about how we could use our advisory times and/or Wednesday late starts for career exploration events. Could we put together a semester calendar that each week is a different career pathway and we have optional business panels present during advisory?
