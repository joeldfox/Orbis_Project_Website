              <h2>EL Program in Ankeny Community School District
</h2>
                <p>(CONTINUE PROJECT FROM A TEAM'S WORK LAST YEAR)  Ankeny has a growing population of students whose home language or first language is not English.  When new families move into the district, we want them to feel welcome and informed about their new school and district.  At a conference, we learned that other schools are welcoming these families through videos that introduce them to the school and some key people within the school.  We would love to re-create this type of video at the schools with EL populations within Ankeny and offer the video in multiple languages.  We would hope to involve our own EL students in the decision-making and creation of these videos, but we know we cannot do it alone!  We would love help brainstorming key information to include in the videos, creating scripts, filming, editing, etc. for this project.

                <p>I am looking to start a nonprofit for my new pharmacy startup; VaxiTaxi.com. The fund would  serve as a means for donors to pay for the administration fee of pharmacists giving vaccines for children (VFC). The VFC program was established to provide no cost vaccines to kids in low income homes. To  my knowledge, the VFC program to receive and dispense free government vaccines is very cumbersome  and not profitable, as providers are contracted to not charge. Hence, most pharmacies do not participate and there is a huge missed opportunity. 
Furthermore, the fund would allow for VaxiTaxi.com pharmacists to provide vaccines to adults with no insurance that can not afford care. If a patient received a vaccine, then the claim VaxiTaxi.com submits is rejected b/c the patient is no longer covered,, the pharmacists administering the vaccine is out the cost of their time and vaccine. Our billing company estimates  this happens with 5% of claims.  This is not a sustainable for part time seasonal help.
The  fund would also pay pharmacists for their time contacting insurers to locate their members that are behind on immunizations, and then  spend time and energy connecting with those patients. Lastly, it’s a great opportunity for VaxiTaxi.com to donate product that is approaching expiration date, and still pay a pharmacist to administer it.

                <p>Hugs for Whoever was began during onboarding of second semester of the 2020/2021 school year. We had a project to basically increase gratitude in the community. We narrowed that down to highschoolers showing gratitude to outsiders in there lives (strangers or acquaintances, although this would subsequently be helpful toward close friends/family aswell). We then did some learning (see link(s) below) and tried to come up with solutions, but realized the true need is that highschoolers do not have the skills or habits to show true meaningful gratitude often. That brought us to HMW create a system or incentive for elementary school kids to increase meaningful gratitude? However, that is a longer project and we wanted to move on so we did some prototyping and just applied it to our Orbis block. The "Menu of Activities Doc" with the provided link has the prototyping information that we did.
