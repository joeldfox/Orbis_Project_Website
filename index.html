</h2>
                <p>Hugs for Whoever was began during onboarding of second semester of the 2020/2021 school year. We had a project to basically increase gratitude in the community. We narrowed that down to highschoolers showing gratitude to outsiders in there lives (strangers or acquaintances, although this would subsequently be helpful toward close friends/family aswell). We then did some learning (see link(s) below) and tried to come up with solutions, but realized the true need is that highschoolers do not have the skills or habits to show true meaningful gratitude often. That brought us to HMW create a system or incentive for elementary school kids to increase meaningful gratitude? However, that is a longer project and we wanted to move on so we did some prototyping and just applied it to our Orbis block. The "Menu of Activities Doc" with the provided link has the prototyping information that we did.

                <p>I want to improve my business by having our product in big stores and gas stations. I have special products such as sauces and fresh falafel. 
Turn Key Falafel Products 
To Whom It May Concern,
I am Thaer Taha, Owner of Taza Fresh Food Truck.  My falafel entrée placed first prize in 2018 and 2019 Food Truck Throw Down.  I developed the Turn Key Falafel Program as cooking has been my passion and after many years of cooking Middle Eastern Cuisine and specializing in award winning falafel. 
I created the Turn Key Falafel Program because there is a need in the market for a plant based protein entrée. It is healthy, delicious and very popular choice not for just vegetarians but for everyone; especially if prepared fresh and made to order.  Falafel is can be eaten as a snack, side or main course.  The biggest challenge is to make it fresh and the consistency is biggest struggle.  A professional person who is skilled with many years of experience can find this complicated to achieve.  I came up with a simple solution when we witnessed our customer's love for falafel and they are finding it hard to find fresh falafel in the market.  Our customers drive up to an hour just because they can't find it anywhere else.  
What is the Turn Key Falafel Program?
• Process that provides the perfect recipe
• Includes falafel machine, falafel mix and sauces
• Training and support to use machine and how to assemble for presentation
• A full or partial menu option
• Low cost to produce and high profit margin
Why us, the program and falafel?
• Our product is loved by our customers.  I know this first hand and food judges agreed two years in a row!
• No competition.
• No extra employee skills or experience required.  This program  will do all the work.
• Low food cost and high profit margin.
• Small Footprint Only 1' x 3' counter space and 220v electric power needed. 
• Can be served for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  It is easy to hold, not messy, eaten as a snack, side or a main course. 
• Great source of protein and the best choice for vegetarians.
•.      The falafel products will add more value to the stores 
• Falafel is naturally gluten, sugar and nut free.
Adding this to your business is an integral part of the food that people are currently seeking in the marketplace.  You need to be one of the first to provide this quick and easy option in your stores and gas stations.

Your team may also have the opportunity to participate in installation of the new signs.

                <p>I am not sure of the exact "problem" to solve, or "idea" to present - but I think there could be value in educating students identifying as LGBTQ to become educated on mental health and advocacy. Perhaps a connection or program to assist students. If you are interested, I am sure we could brainstorm and come up with a solid project. 
I am not sure if some of this information already exists for your staff – however, wondering if it could/would potentially be an Orbis project for advocating for students identifying as LGBTQ. Perhaps resources, presentation, connecting to Iowa Safe Schools. As I work in mental health – this population has a significant risk of suicide and mental health concerns and support from teachers is of utmost importance, especially if they do not have this support at home. With the book bans by many school boards across the metro, I know many of my children's friends have concerns about being accepted at school.
I know Orbis typically works with business, but if you have a group of students interested in DEI work – I would be willing to mentor a team of students if that fits with your objectives of Orbis.

</h2>
                <p>Cafeteria Food Waste / Food Insecurity:
I have lunch duty every day with 6th and 7th graders who throw away way too much untouched food!  I've talked to the cafeteria workers and janitors about setting up a basket for uneaten fruits like bananas, apples, and oranges.  They told me they have tried in the past but nutrition services won't allow it because of the foods being touched.  
We have a Parkview student whose family established and maintains food donation boxes around town called ‘The Helping Hands' boxes.  He is interested in trying to get unused cafeteria food for the donation boxes, but he doesn't know how to go about setting it up.

              <h2>Ankeny Economic Development Corporaton
</h2>
                <p>Ankeny school district data from 2019 shows there is a significant difference in pass rates (scoring 3 or higher) between female and male students who take AP exams. Since it has been shown that intellectual abilities are not unique to a gender it is important to understand why the pass rate is lower for female students. Is this issue specific to one school year or is it a bigger trend? Is data available across multiple years? If so, what does it show? If it is more than one year what could be contributing factors to the difference? Are females receiving different instruction? Are females taking more difficult subjects? Are fewer females taking the AP exams? Could there be other factors at play? 
In addition to myself, Jake Kerber would be a good advisor on this project to provide an additional lens.

                <p>I would like students to come up with a sort of tutorial on a website, google doc, etc that would show students how to use Canvas.  I think this would be great for the students to have access to if they were new to Canvas, or even just forgot how to do something.  Someway for them to have simple instructions with pictures, arrows, descriptions, and even videos of how to turn in an assignment, take a test, see what assignments are missing, message your teacher, use the calendar, would just be a few ideas.

                <p>1.I would like to have students design a "Kinzler App" that would link to our software providing employees a single sign-on app to all their systems/software at Kinzler (time clock, paystubs, PTO, etc.) this would also function like a social media app similar to a Facebook or LinkedIn feed where Kinzler and the employees can share relevant and fun information.  I would also like the ability to text employees from this app for immediate communication to cell phones.
