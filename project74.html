            <p><b>Information: </b> Finding a site in Ankeny, working with a developer, and having the students come up with an idea to pitch to them for development.  For instance, what does Ankeny not have that a high school student would like to see in our community or something that the surrounding neighbors would like to see.  They would have to go through the process of what it takes to develop a property and pitch it to an Owner.
