            <p><b>Information: </b> My name is Christine Clark. I am a transformational Life Coach.  My company is SunGlow Transformation.
My current challenge is in-person visibility.  Getting in front of groups of people so they can experience me.  With personal experience individuals understand what life coaching can provide for them which opens the door to choosing private coaching as part of their life fulfillment formula. 
1) What are the ways that I might address this challenge?  I am open to your brainstorming ideas and what your custom designed project(s) would look like.
2) My idea/Project: 
In video: https://youtu.be/fiuqS-tQZaA
I would like to have a marketing video and a brochure that promotes my keynote address, "Forging Your Life: Truths in Creation of Katana". The video would give individuals a taste of the personal experience. Nice.  It would also be an incentive for organizations and companies to invite me to speak.
My idea combines all the elements of a TED Talk. You would be the creators of a live inspirational event.  There are a plethora of unique tasks in this single concept.
If you choose this as your project here are some of the cool things your team could be doing:
With a limited budget
* Secure a venue
* Market and "sell" free admission to the event
      * Design brochures, social media posts and tickets 
      *  Promote the event across the community 
* Design the stage area - think TED
      * Back drop(s), Screen for Powerpoint, props
      * Lighting & sound
* During the event
      * Introduce Coach Christine Clark as the MC 
      * Video and photo record speaker and audience
* Reception area where audience can interact personally with Coach Christine
      * Light refreshments
      * Opportunity for video and photos of personal interactions
* After event create marketing pieces
      * Brochure
      * Videos: 5 - 10 minute promo; 1 - 2 minute trailer, 30 - 60 second reel
Bring your thoughts, ideas, and suggestions.  I look forward to sharing Forging Your Life with you and collaborating to make this a fun, inspiring and impactful project.
