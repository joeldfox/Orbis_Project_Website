            <p><b>Information: </b> Birds & Bees Soap LLC is a local bar soap business started by two Ankeny Centennial former students this summer. (Tommy and Michael currently are at Iowa State.) Tommy originally started making bar soap during his senior year knowing he can do better than the name brands. Michael had previously gone through ORBIS and was brought on as his partner. We are looking to increase our social media presence and attract more customers to our sustainable soap. We are looking for committed innovators to work together and achieve all of our respective goals.
