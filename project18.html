            <p><b>Information: </b> Hugs for Whoever was began during onboarding of second semester of the 2020/2021 school year. We had a project to basically increase gratitude in the community. We narrowed that down to highschoolers showing gratitude to outsiders in there lives (strangers or acquaintances, although this would subsequently be helpful toward close friends/family aswell). We then did some learning (see link(s) below) and tried to come up with solutions, but realized the true need is that highschoolers do not have the skills or habits to show true meaningful gratitude often. That brought us to HMW create a system or incentive for elementary school kids to increase meaningful gratitude? However, that is a longer project and we wanted to move on so we did some prototyping and just applied it to our Orbis block. The "Menu of Activities Doc" with the provided link has the prototyping information that we did.

</p>
            <p><b>Purpose:</b> There is no organization, but I would say If we can instill these skills and habits into young kids, by the time they are in highschool showing meaningfull gratitude will be second nature to them. It will not be scary, confusing, or hard for them. This will benefit our whole community.
