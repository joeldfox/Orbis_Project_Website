            <p><b>Information: </b> Our hope/intention is to improve the branding and appearance of certain Centennial High School public spaces. For example: in the new wing and new weight room, many of the walls are bare and would benefit from some updated Jaguar branding. Other Centennial hallways could also use upgrades, additional messaging, etc. that reflect the welcoming and positive environment of Centennial High School. 
Some ideas we have include incorporating vinyl wraps, wall graphics/murals, large wall logos (Jaguar logo, ACHS logo, etc.), large canvas banners and/or flags, dimensional lettering, among other things.
Recently, Ankeny schools has updated it's mission statement and portrait of a graduate. These are potential things that could be incorporated into this idea along with building specific information (the Jag creed, Centennial logos, etc.) and/or examples of student work/projects (student art, etc.)
