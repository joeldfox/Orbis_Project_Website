            <p><b>Information: </b> One of the issues that came up from the recent presentation was the DMACC website. I'd like to propose that the next project be an evaluation of DMACC's website and those of other colleges and universities that they are interested in. What do the student's like/dislike about the DMACC website. What website categories are most important to them? What visuals interest them? How can the DMACC website be a better resource to them?
</p>
            <p><b>Purpose:</b> A website is an organizations most important marketing resource and introduction to an organization's brand. Insights from prospective students is crucial in providing an a quality recruiting tool and will help drive traffic and interest in the College.
