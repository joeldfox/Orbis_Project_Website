            <p><b>Information: </b> The  fund would also pay pharmacists for their time contacting insurers to locate their members that are behind on immunizations, and then  spend time and energy connecting with those patients. Lastly, it's a great opportunity for VaxiTaxi.com to donate product that is approaching expiration date, and still pay a pharmacist to administer it.
