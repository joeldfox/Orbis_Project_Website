            <p><b>Information: </b> Jensen Builders, Ltd. is a Design-Build General Contractor with office locations in Fort Dodge, IA and Des Moines, IA.  Jensen Builders, Ltd. has been in business since 1983.  We self-perform project management, concrete work, steel erection, and both rough and finish carpentry.  We specialize in building retail centers, restaurants, office buildings, fast food facilities, ag buildings, grain bins, schools, etc.   We also have an in-house architect and draftsman, as well as 2 full time mechanics that manage the maintenance on our fleet of over 120 vehicles, as well as all company machinery.
Currently, we employ approximately 235 employees between our Fort Dodge and Des Moines, IA location.  We would like students to create a year round marketing and recruiting plan that targets graduating students as well as others in the community that are interested in the trades.  Where should we be advertising? What are students looking for in an employer? How do we get in front of students to explain our company and what it has to offer?  How do we reach individuals currently working elsewhere to try and recruit those that are happy with their current employer?  What technology should we be using to get in front of potential applicants? What would you change about our website?  How can we gain exposure throughout Iowa as far as potential customers and applicants?  How can we increase our applicants? How can we inform others about the potential financial stability we have to offer?  
We would like students to create a 12 month recruiting/marketing plan that appeals to potential applicants throughout Iowa.
