            <p><b>Information: </b> PTO is wanting to update the landscaping around Westwood elementary to create a more warm and welcoming environment for our families and staff. Our current landscaping consists of trees and a few shrubs. 
We would also like to update the ball field in our playground area as it is used for kickball during the school day and by our community in the evenings for ball practice. If you would have other ideas for updating the playground area, we would also be interested in seeing those.
We would like help developing a landscaping plan, ball field plan (the students have asked to have bases added) and how much these updates would cost. We would like to start implementing these changes/updates during the 2022 - 2023 school year. 
</p>
            <p><b>Purpose:</b> 5/1/2023
