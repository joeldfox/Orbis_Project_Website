            <p><b>Information: </b> The elementary digital learning team would like to get our third-fifth grade students to excited about keyboarding.  We would like to get them more interested by building some reasoning as to why this is important in their future.  Could you please create a 5 minute or shorter video for us to show all Ankeny schools 3rd-5th graders stating different ways keyboarding is helpful in middle school and above.  For example, you can get your homework done faster, all teachers expect you to know how to type etc.
