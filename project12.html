            <p><b>Information: </b> DMACC needs to "pivot' our career exploration days (Career Discovery Days) to a virtual delivery for the semester. I would like to hear from students what might work and what might not work.  What time of day? How long? What do students want to get out of the experience? 
</p>
            <p><b>Purpose:</b> I am working to create a video library of Career Presentations as a substitute for live career speakers in high school classrooms. I am struggling to find time to do the editing myself, and I don't have the skills needed without teaching myself how to do some editing.  Our marketing department has been short-staffed due to some furloughed employees due to COVID.
