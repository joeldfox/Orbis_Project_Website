            <p><b>Information: </b> Cafeteria Food Waste / Food Insecurity:
I have lunch duty every day with 6th and 7th graders who throw away way too much untouched food!  I've talked to the cafeteria workers and janitors about setting up a basket for uneaten fruits like bananas, apples, and oranges.  They told me they have tried in the past but nutrition services won't allow it because of the foods being touched.  
We have a Parkview student whose family established and maintains food donation boxes around town called ‘The Helping Hands' boxes.  He is interested in trying to get unused cafeteria food for the donation boxes, but he doesn't know how to go about setting it up.
