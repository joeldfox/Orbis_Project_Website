            <p><b>Information: </b> We want to install QR codes on our exhibits in the museum. We need to post webpages on our website that provide information about the exhibits visitors are viewing that link to these QR codes. We would also like to have some auto and/or walking tours (historical, amenities, recreation, shopping, etc.)  of Ankeny for new residents, young, and older to access on our webpage and listen to from our website. We also have a need to digitize photos,  documents, and other artifacts. 2023 is the 120th year of Ankeny's incorporation would like to have a small event or display to celebrate. 2025 is the Sesquicentennial of Ankeny's founding and we we like to contribute to the City and Chamber of Commerce committees our part of the celebration.
