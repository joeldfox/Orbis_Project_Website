            <p><b>Purpose:</b> Kelly - We have so many AMAZING elective opportunities at our high schools, but we want to be able to clearly share these opportunities (like Orbis) with our students and parents.  The best way we can think to do this is by having videos for each of our different "clusters" or types of electives.
Janae - (We wanted help creating something like videos, that described the courses to our 9th graders, especially the elective courses.  Possibly video taping Building Construction, in action with a brief description of the course and a reminder that “intro to construction” is a pre-requisite & it is a block class for 1 semester only, etc.
Our course catalog is just words in a book.  Have the Orbis kids help us so it is better when we go to NV  and have kids sign up for classes…. )
