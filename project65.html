            <p><b>Information: </b> We are a very busy truck and car repair shop. We always have too many vehicles on our lot.  Some are abandoned and need to go away.  Some are done and need to be picked up.  Some are here to be worked on.  When customers arrive, they often just park anywhere and that adds to the congestion.  We need a system or systems in place that will keep the lot more organized and cleared out as much as possible.
