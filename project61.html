            <p><b>Information: </b> Unique Challenge = Affordable Housing - Construction.  One of the most challenging issues facing home builders in Iowa is the construction of affordable housing for the average Iowa household.  In particular in rural Iowa.  Material and labor prices have hit all-time highs making new housing unaffordable for many families.  Our company wants to be able to build affordable housing for all age groups and has found this more and more difficult.  What can be done to help solve this challenge?  What building methods/techniques and products...etc. can be used to assist with this growing issue.  Thank you.
