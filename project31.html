            <p><b>Information: </b> The Ankeny Area Chamber of Commerce would like to have an Orbis Student Group help with the social media marketing efforts to increase visibility to the community.  Our main focus is to enhance the visibility of our members to the community.    We feel there is a huge benefit in creating a Tik Tok page for both the Ankeny Chamber and Ankeny SummerFest so that we can engage with a whole new audience.    We would also like to create a Pinterest page so that we can continue to increase the SEO for all of our members.  Coming up with a marketing plan, ideas around consistent posts and being creative will be a great way for students to engage with the staff and members of the Ankeny Chamber and the community.
