            <p><b>Information: </b> We are a fairly new nonprofit and would like assistance in creating a database to keep track of those who interact with our organization. We could also use help with fundraising if a group wanted to help organized a fundraising event.
</p>
            <p><b>Purpose:</b> Tracking those who are helping our organization is a real need for us. Currently everything is kept on a spreadsheet. We would be able to better interact with those tied to our nonprofit if we had an easy way to keep them organized.
