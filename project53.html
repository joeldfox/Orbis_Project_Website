            <p><b>Information: </b> OVERVIEW
The Ankeny School Foundation is a volunteer-run organization that raises money for grants to
cover the cost of equipment and projects beyond the regular district budget. One of the
foundation's major fundraising events is the Hawk Jag 5k Run. The event has minimal overhead
and reliably turns a small profit. It has not, however, generated the number of participants or the
margins expected for the amount of volunteer hours invested. Its future as an event is in
question.
GOALS
1. Orbis students will examine all aspects of the event and make recommendations on how
to increase participation in the run.
2. Orbis students will examine all aspects of the event and make recommendations on how
to increase revenue to $10,000.
3. Orbis students will provide three examples of other ways to raise money for the Ankeny
School Foundation (game night, trivia night, BINGO night, etc.).
