            <p><b>Information: </b> One of the issues that came up from the recent presentation was the DMACC website. I'd like to propose that the next project be an evaluation of DMACC's website and those of other colleges and universities that they are interested in. What do the student's like/dislike about the DMACC website. What website categories are most important to them? What visuals interest them? How can the DMACC website be a better resource to them?
</p>
            <p><b>Purpose:</b> This would make our customers happy by not sending the wrong product.  It would save us time and money by not working on the wrong items and it would save us money in shipping for resending the correct material.
