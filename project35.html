            <p><b>Information: </b> Always have a variety of challenges that we face so when the program has a time slot we can discuss the best fit, size & scope of the project based on student numbers & teacher goals.  
Dicussed program thsi semester with Cleao Murray (my Daughter & current student in the program) she has spoken very highly of it & the teachers that lead it) the idea of having my office available for student/teacher off site meetings etc is somehting we cna discuss as well.  Pretty flexible in most of this area, have several companies from Manufacturing to Real Estate that can be explored with a variety of things that pop up for a think tank or project managment type oppotunity.
