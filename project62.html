            <p><b>Information: </b> ORBIS has created a Seed Saving Seed Sharing Library during a prvious project with Cherry Glen Learning Farm.  With our present climatic changes affecting food security, I would like to see an ORBIS team gain access to "indignous seed sources" for more resilient biodiversity in our table food production. I have been trying to develop a partnership with indiginous groups for several years without success.  I feel it would be most beneficial to have the Indiginous tribe you work with, present to your school, their relationship with food production + soil sustainbility + water quality in regards to their 
traditional  beliefs and sovereign nation status. Then we will show the same consideration, respect and care for the seed they en-trust us with.    I will send an email to Mz Amy Steenhoek, with several contacts that have working relationships with  indiginous tribes.    Thank you  Dr.  Ray   Meylor   Cherry Glen Learning Farm
