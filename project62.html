            <p><b>Information: </b> Our elementary students get introduced to keyboarding and start to learn how to keyboard. However, due to heavy access of computers, most have already learned bad typing habits by "hen-pecking."  We struggle getting student buy in. We would like one short video highlighting Ankeny students who can type and can speak to the benefits of learning to type, such as taking notes is faster, homework is faster, and more. Why is it important to gain typing skills? This video will be showed to every elementary building during media class.
