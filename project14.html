            <p><b>Information: </b> With our vast array of cloth and paper backed materials we are sending the wrong product or wrong color of the correct product to our customers.  Our current systems are somewhat antiquated and we do not have a good quality check system to validate correct product is going to the customer.   Would like to have a system that does not solely rely on the employee alone.
</p>
            <p><b>Purpose:</b> This would make our customers happy by not sending the wrong product.  It would save us time and money by not working on the wrong items and it would save us money in shipping for resending the correct material.
