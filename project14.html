            <p><b>Information: </b> Video editing for Career Discovery Career Presentations. I would be happy to work with any students that have video editing expertise and would like some real-world projects. 
</p>
            <p><b>Purpose:</b> Hearing directly from students and allowing them to be a part of the process will allow us to deliver a quality experience quicker, without having to do so many "pivots" and trials before we land on what works.  The audience is high school students, so we need to make sure the virtual events we are planning actually reflect what students want and are delivered at a time that they can attend.
