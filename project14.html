            <p><b>Information: </b> We would like a team of innovators to help us improve the Orbis website to help us tell our story so that we can make a bigger impact on our community and meet the needs of those who might access it (students, parents, workforce).
</p>
            <p><b>Purpose:</b> I am working to create a video library of Career Presentations as a substitute for live career speakers in high school classrooms. I am struggling to find time to do the editing myself, and I don't have the skills needed without teaching myself how to do some editing.  Our marketing department has been short-staffed due to some furloughed employees due to COVID.
