            <p><b>Information: </b> 3 different challenges:  
1--Alpha serves women from many different cultures, and we want to serve them well!  What are suggestions for how to help bridge the cultural gap between American and Hispanic, Bosnian, Asian, other minority and refugee communities.  How do we incorporate those ideas into our interactions with our clients? 
2--Alpha seeks to help women who are afraid they might be pregnant, or they need to know if they're pregnant, or they need a safe place to sort through what they're thinking.  How do we "catch the eye" of these young women so that they know we're here to help?  How do we do that without spending money.  Simple things.  
3--Our parking lot needs repair/replacement.  Research pros/cons between asphalt vs. concrete, research expected costs/time involved.
