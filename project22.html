            <p><b>Information: </b> I am looking for an app to assist with the boxes. Something that lists all the locations, with a one click option to go to google maps, and possibly a way people can “check in” and show if a box is full, empty or half. I’m happy to explain in more detail, or am open to suggestions on what all an app could include. 
</p>
            <p><b>Purpose:</b> Right now my donors sometimes have to drive around to boxes if the first few are full. I appreciate their time and support, I would love for an app to easily direct them to what boxes are low and in need of supplies, without driving around town. It takes 3.5 hours to drive to each box in town, and fill it.
