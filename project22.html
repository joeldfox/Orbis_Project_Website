            <p><b>Information: </b> (CONTINUATION of a project from last year)  My past Orbis group have worked on assisting the ACSD ESL program and have come up with many solutions, one being creating a video on how our schools work if they are new to the district. Schools run differently all around the world and so it is a struggle for students to be in a new area and be taught in a new way after moving here. 
</p>
            <p><b>Purpose:</b> Creating a video on how our school runs in a typical day will make the incoming ESL students feel much more comfortable and confident when coming into the new school.
