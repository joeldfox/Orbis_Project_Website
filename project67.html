            <p><b>Information: </b> Iowa is experiencing a mental health epidemic. Suicide has been, and continues to be, the second leading cause of death for young people in Iowa, as well as nationally (CDC). One out of five young people has a mental health issue and fewer than 20% of these youth get treatment (CDC). There is a dire shortage in mental health professions in Iowa, especially BIPOC & LGBTQ+ professionals and services in rural communities. We tell youth that they are not alone and, yet many providers for therapy and medication take months to access.
To combat this crisis, Please Pass the Love has developed a mental health hub, Wellness Nest, which is available via Web Browser and Apple and Google play store. With the help of youth feedback, the Wellness Nest app has been intentionally organized into four categories: Stress & Anxiety, Accessing Telehealth, Sleep/Meditation, and Coping Skills/Wellness. All apps in Wellness Nest are required to be evidence-based.
Being able to incorporate behavioral health practices into a student's daily life is the best way to ensure that they have access to the tools that they need for their own mental health while counteracting Iowa's shortage of mental health professionals. Our hope is to increase mental health accessibility and improve mental health outcomes for students with Wellness Nest. 
Now that the app has been developed, our largest challenge has been disseminating this potentially lifesaving resource. There are many ways that youth could help with this project. Some examples could include: leading youth focus groups, sharing Input on aesthetics of Wellness Nest, disseminating Wellness Nest throughout the state of Iowa and potentially nationally, testing apps that can be added to Wellness Nest, developing a mentorship or accountability model that incorporates Wellness Nest into youth daily life, and educating youth, educators, administrators, and parents/community members on the potential impact behavioral health technology services can have on mental health. 
Youth working on this project would receive onboarding, as necessary, so that they can be successful in the project. Youth would also receive continual support from Please Pass the Love's Director of Youth Engagement (and additional staff, as needed.)
