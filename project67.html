            <p><b>Information: </b> We want real world/real life jobs to bring to our classroom at ACHS to package, bag, bundle, etc to help Ankeny businesses.  One example would be the "goodie bags" that you get at the end of the dental visit-we could place the items in bags as a job.  There are probably lots of businesses around town who have conferences that give out welcome bags or have informational folders to be assembled-we want to do that for them.  I just don't know how to find these jobs for my students to do.  (Actually, both High Schools have World of Work classes, so if it were a big job, we'd share it).  We just want more real jobs to work on and think this could be helpful to the right people.
INFO FROM MEETING:  
THEIR NEEDS:
1)  A SYSTEM to track needs of organizations  (current needs, record of work they have done)
2) RECRUIT work that needs to be done  (work needs to be easily assemblable & the organization needs to be flexible with the quality of the work [it won't all be perfect])
