            <p><b>Information: </b> We are working towards engaging students in early workforce development and information regarding what is needed to prepare for a professional career. We want to get information from students, past and present (if possible) on how we best can do this as an organization. We would like students to develop something similar in terms of how they would best drive or lead a career presentation that would engage them and their peers. This could be a mock presentation, a flyer, etc.
We have provided below some sample questions to drive the conversation and project and provide a basis for the direction. 
1) How should we best engage students (format, timing, resources we provide, etc.)
2) What information would you find to be most helpful that companies could provide
3) What questions need to be answered but never seem to be answered at career fairs or during presentations
4) How do you find out about careers? (social media, friends, word of mouth)
</p>
            <p><b>Purpose:</b> This will provide us a better basis for how to move forward with our community engagement efforts towards high schoolers to make sure we provide information that best fits their needs.
