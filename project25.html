            <p><b>Information: </b> We'd like to get employee engagement feedback.  It would be good to see how employees view current internal communication effectiveness, timing, relevancy, etc.  This would include their thoughts and opinions on how we can improve.  
We'd also like to get feedback on how employees would like to receive training, topics to cover, etc.  
This would be done in the form of an online survey.  After the survey I'd like the team to provide me an executive report with statistics and recommendations.
