            <p><b>Information: </b> HMW.... help a teacher who desires to incorporate more key elements of Orbis into their course to best prepare students for their futures.
HMW support a teacher in implementing more learner-centered education?  (Build out ways to support other Ts in doing it too)
</p>
            <p><b>Purpose:</b> ASCD HR is moving forward with an inclusion-based recruiting campaign. We have not done an actual audit of our current materials to get a baseline idea of how well we've done in the past representing diversity and inclusion concepts. We are looking a sharp team of Orbis members to help us understand the  "who and what's missing" in telling our story as we recruit more strategically.
