            <p><b>Information: </b> The Superintendent would like to begin a weekly or bi-weekly podcast to solve the challenge of helping connect parents in a more authentic way to the work of the school district. 
</p>
            <p><b>Purpose:</b> We want parents and the community at large to have a better understanding of some of the key initiatives of the district including enrollment and boundary changes, facility additions and growth, updating our strategic plan, implementing a DEI framework, developing the profile of an Ankeny graduate, and more. There is so much work being done each year, but it seems that lately the only thing resonating with our audience is related to COVID and we want to help engage them on some of these big, long-term projects that will affect the school district for a long time.
