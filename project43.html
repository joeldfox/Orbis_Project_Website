            <p><b>Information: </b> We are a full-service travel agency, but would like to expand our business model to include online sales or travel-related products. We've explored options of white-label products, explore logistical issues, manufacturing and production challenges and this kept us from launching this last year, but would like to explore the opportunity again as we continue to expand our brand in Iowa and throughout the mid-west. In addition to this project that explores launching product and an online store, we would love to discuss the possibility of marketing, social media interns, graphic designers enrolled in Orbis to help with marketing materials and outreach strategies in the greater Des Moines /Iowa region.
I look forward to discussing this project and the potential to work and mentor students on small business operations in the travel industry. 
I have other ideas, too!! I am working on starting up a monthly small business roundtable with local owners where each members presents an issue they are dealing with and we have a whiteboard session with other owners to discuss solutions. Perhaps this is something students can be involved with. 
Thanks for your consideration!
