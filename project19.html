            <p><b>Information: </b> I am looking to start a nonprofit for my new pharmacy startup; VaxiTaxi.com. The fund would  serve as a means for donors to pay for the administration fee of pharmacists giving vaccines for children (VFC). The VFC program was established to provide no cost vaccines to kids in low income homes. To  my knowledge, the VFC program to receive and dispense free government vaccines is very cumbersome  and not profitable, as providers are contracted to not charge. Hence, most pharmacies do not participate and there is a huge missed opportunity. 
Furthermore, the fund would allow for VaxiTaxi.com pharmacists to provide vaccines to adults with no insurance that can not afford care. If a patient received a vaccine, then the claim VaxiTaxi.com submits is rejected b/c the patient is no longer covered,, the pharmacists administering the vaccine is out the cost of their time and vaccine. Our billing company estimates  this happens with 5% of claims.  This is not a sustainable for part time seasonal help.
The  fund would also pay pharmacists for their time contacting insurers to locate their members that are behind on immunizations, and then  spend time and energy connecting with those patients. Lastly, it’s a great opportunity for VaxiTaxi.com to donate product that is approaching expiration date, and still pay a pharmacist to administer it.
</p>
            <p><b>Purpose:</b> It would free up my time and funds for other more profitable projects. Also, it would allow for a more-fun/silly outlet ...with a great cause.  Big Shot Foundation.
