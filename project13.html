            <p><b>Information: </b> In an effort to upgrade our technology/online website/social media offerings to the community, AAHS would request a review of our current uses of technology to promote the AAHS and its products .  Ultimately, suggestions of better uses of and upgrading our technology footprint in the community would be appreciated.
</p>
            <p><b>Purpose:</b> Hearing directly from students and allowing them to be a part of the process will allow us to deliver a quality experience quicker, without having to do so many "pivots" and trials before we land on what works.  The audience is high school students, so we need to make sure the virtual events we are planning actually reflect what students want and are delivered at a time that they can attend.
