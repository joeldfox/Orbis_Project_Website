            <p><b>Information: </b> We would like to mobilize the Orbis troops to create videos for our different elective "clusters" for AHS and ACHS. 
</p>
            <p><b>Purpose:</b> More effectively telling our story will help us connect more with organizations in our community which will hopefully lead to more opportunities to partner with a wider variety of organizations and make the biggest impact we possibly can.  This would also allow us to have a wide variety of project opportunities for innovators to choose from.
It will also help us recruit and promote to future innovators and their parents.
