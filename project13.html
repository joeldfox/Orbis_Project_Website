            <p><b>Information: </b> With our vast array of cloth and paper backed materials we are sending the wrong product or wrong color of the correct product to our customers.  Our current systems are somewhat antiquated and we do not have a good quality check system to validate correct product is going to the customer.   Would like to have a system that does not solely rely on the employee alone.

            <p><b>Purpose:</b> I am working to create a video library of Career Presentations as a substitute for live career speakers in high school classrooms. I am struggling to find time to do the editing myself, and I don't have the skills needed without teaching myself how to do some editing.  Our marketing department has been short-staffed due to some furloughed employees due to COVID.
