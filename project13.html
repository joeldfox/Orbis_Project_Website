            <p><b>Information: </b> Video editing for Career Discovery Career Presentations. I would be happy to work with any students that have video editing expertise and would like some real-world projects. 
</p>
            <p><b>Purpose:</b> More effectively telling our story will help us connect more with organizations in our community which will hopefully lead to more opportunities to partner with a wider variety of organizations and make the biggest impact we possibly can.  This would also allow us to have a wide variety of project opportunities for innovators to choose from.
It will also help us recruit and promote to future innovators and their parents.
