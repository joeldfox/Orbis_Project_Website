            <p><b>Information: </b> I am interested in gather ideas on how to introduce DIY and woodworking to the younger generations. This could potentially start with High School/ MIddle School shop classes. Or... with the swing to more virtual classes, what would a virtual wood working class look like? All interesting opportunities to develop a base for the younger generation.
</p>
            <p><b>Purpose:</b> There is no organization, but I would say If we can instill these skills and habits into young kids, by the time they are in highschool showing meaningfull gratitude will be second nature to them. It will not be scary, confusing, or hard for them. This will benefit our whole community.
