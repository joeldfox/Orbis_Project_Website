            <p><b>Information: </b> I'm looking for a team of creative students with a passion for graphic design, computer illustration and project coordination. The project is to create modern, attractive signs for the disc golf course at Big Creek State Park.  You will be responsible for creating the graphical maps for each sign using Adobe Illustrator and Adobe InDesign. The graphical maps will be based on digital drone scans provided by John Deere.  You will execute field studies (walking through the course) to ensure that the maps you create match the current state of the physical landscape. (Certain trees are now missing following the derecho.) You will use the U-Disc app to verify that pars and distances are correct. You'll work with an engineer and a graphic designer who will coach you on how to create the signs.  Once your designs have been reviewed and approved, they will be manufactured at John Deere.  Your team may also have the opportunity to participate in installation of the new signs.
