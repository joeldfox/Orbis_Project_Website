            <p><b>Information: </b> Profession Awareness Issue
Certified Medical Assistant is one of the only professions specifically trained for all things doctor's office. When people go to the doctor's office they often think it's a "nurse" bringing them back not realizing they're two different professions.
How can we raise profession awareness in our community and increase the DMACC Medical Assistant student program numbers? Our community is in crisis due to the shortage of medical assistants.
We would love to get together and brainstorm! We actually have 2 programs that might benefit.
Medical Assistant Program (MAP)
Medical Lab Tech (MLT)
