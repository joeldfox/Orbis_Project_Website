            <p><b>Information: </b> I am not sure of the exact "problem" to solve, or "idea" to present - but I think there could be value in educating students identifying as LGBTQ to become educated on mental health and advocacy. Perhaps a connection or program to assist students. If you are interested, I am sure we could brainstorm and come up with a solid project. 
I am not sure if some of this information already exists for your staff – however, wondering if it could/would potentially be an Orbis project for advocating for students identifying as LGBTQ. Perhaps resources, presentation, connecting to Iowa Safe Schools. As I work in mental health – this population has a significant risk of suicide and mental health concerns and support from teachers is of utmost importance, especially if they do not have this support at home. With the book bans by many school boards across the metro, I know many of my children's friends have concerns about being accepted at school.
I know Orbis typically works with business, but if you have a group of students interested in DEI work – I would be willing to mentor a team of students if that fits with your objectives of Orbis.
