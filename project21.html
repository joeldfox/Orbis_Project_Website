            <p><b>Information: </b> We are interested in ways to get more middle school - high school students involved in parks and rec programming.  From specific sports offerings, to direct programs like martial arts and cooking classes/computer classes, how do we get more involvement with this block of students?  Looking at this from the side of how to market to the group on a continuous basis, to what types and prices of programming.
</p>
            <p><b>Purpose:</b> ASCD HR is moving forward with an inclusion-based recruiting campaign. We have not done an actual audit of our current materials to get a baseline idea of how well we've done in the past representing diversity and inclusion concepts. We are looking a sharp team of Orbis members to help us understand the  "who and what's missing" in telling our story as we recruit more strategically.
