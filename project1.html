            <p><b>Information: </b> There is a need for expanding the clothing and swag options for Orbis, Currently, some options are available with one local business, and we'd like to expand to include other local businesses.  People have expressed wanting additional clothing options, as well as shirts that include our phrase "Unleash passion." Realize potential. Impact the world."  I'm also looking for some student creativity in proposing ideas we have not thought of yet.
</p>
            <p><b>Purpose:</b> Parents from multiple language backgrounds will be better informed about their child's new school!  Hopefully they will also feel welcomed by the community and be willing to engage with the school.
