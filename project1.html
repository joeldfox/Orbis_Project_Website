            <p><b>Information: </b> There is a need for expanding the clothing and swag options for Orbis, Currently, some options are available with one local business, and we'd like to expand to include other local businesses.  People have expressed wanting additional clothing options, as well as shirts that include our phrase "Unleash passion." Realize potential. Impact the world."  I'm also looking for some student creativity in proposing ideas we have not thought of yet.
</p>
            <p><b>Purpose:</b> We are intentional in creating a "community atmosphere" in Orbis where every student feels a sense of belonging.  Having Orbis clothing is a way to reinforce our sense of community.   Also, our student are our best "advertisement" for Orbis.  It's great marketing for other students to enroll in Orbis!
