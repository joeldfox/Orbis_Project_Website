            <p><b>Information: </b> I am considering starting a non-profit that could help people with diabetes who can't afford their needed insulin due to a short-term obstacle (job loss, etc.).  I would like help looking into the problem and how I would go about starting up a non-profit.  I'd like to set up a network where people could request assistance and money for the needed insulin could be dispersed either to the individual or a pharmacy.
Many diabetics have had to ration their insulin to make ends meet and this practice is not safe, but people are forced into it in certain sitations because of the high cost of insulin and a gap in coverage. 
(PERSONAL EXPERIENCE:  My husband has Type 1 Diabetes and relies on his insulin to live.  During the pandemic, he lost his job and with it the health insurance that he relied on to help offest the cost of his insulin.  His insurance was about to run out when he thankfully got another job.  We came dangerously close to having a gap in our coverage which would have led to major financial difficulties.  Many are in much worse situations than we were but the fear and gravity of the situation became very real to us during this difficult time.  I want to help others in similar situations.)
</p>
            <p><b>Purpose:</b> I'd like help looking into how to start a non-profit to meet the needs of diabetics.
