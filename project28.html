            <p><b>Information: </b> The AAHS needs the print media we currently have reviewed and updated. Ron Sampson and I would lead project.  The current pamphlet (newspaper style) we share with members and visitors is seriously outdated and needs a facelift. The AAHS has examples of the original and some suggestions for what we would like included in an updated version. 
</p>
            <p><b>Purpose:</b> As the AAHS uses many mediums (physical print material, the AAHS website, Facebook, etc) to reach the public we serve, members, future members, and the community, its physical print pamphlet needs to represent the AAHS most current functioning and an uodated version would help promote the AAHS and museums to the public.
