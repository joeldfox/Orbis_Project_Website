            <p><b>Information: </b> College-wide, DMACC is undertaking a significant effort to better understand the issues related to diversity, equity, and inclusion in order to make changes that will improve the DMACC experience for all students and specifically those students who identify as part of a traditionally marginalized group. I am part of a sub-committee working on student engagement. We are looking at it in three phases - Prospective Students, Current Students, and Alumni Students. We would like to better understand how prospective students see DMACC from a diversity, equity, and inclusion lens and also work to improve student engagement with this in mind. 
</p>
            <p><b>Purpose:</b> More effectively telling our story will help us connect more with organizations in our community which will hopefully lead to more opportunities to partner with a wider variety of organizations and make the biggest impact we possibly can.  This would also allow us to have a wide variety of project opportunities for innovators to choose from.
It will also help us recruit and promote to future innovators and their parents.
