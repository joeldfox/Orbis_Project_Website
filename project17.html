            <p><b>Information: </b> College-wide, DMACC is undertaking a significant effort to better understand the issues related to diversity, equity, and inclusion in order to make changes that will improve the DMACC experience for all students and specifically those students who identify as part of a traditionally marginalized group. I am part of a sub-committee working on student engagement. We are looking at it in three phases - Prospective Students, Current Students, and Alumni Students. We would like to better understand how prospective students see DMACC from a diversity, equity, and inclusion lens and also work to improve student engagement with this in mind. 
</p>
            <p><b>Purpose:</b> A website is an organizations most important marketing resource and introduction to an organization's brand. Insights from prospective students is crucial in providing an a quality recruiting tool and will help drive traffic and interest in the College.
