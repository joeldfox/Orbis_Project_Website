            <p><b>Information: </b> I was introduced to the Orbis program from a presentation at my Ankeny Rotary meeting.  very impressed.  As a locally owned small business, we face marketing challenges.  Compared to other HVAC companies we have a very small marketing budget, but have built a business based on integrity.  Most of our business comes from word of mouth.  We would also be willing if any student has an interest in the trades to shadow some of our service techs, office staff or entrepreneurs.  Thank you
