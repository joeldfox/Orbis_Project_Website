            <p><b>Information: </b> We are seeking some help to create STEM festival activities for students in grades K-5. 
The SC STEM Hub is looking for someone to write activities for four kits/topics. You can take on just one of the areas or all four. 
•        a medical kit that includes a torso anatomical model and stethoscope 
•        a set of kid-caliber microscopes
•        a set of snap circuits 
•        a nutrition kit
The activities would be used at STEM festivals and available for area teachers to check out, and they should range between 10-20 minutes. 
In addition to creating an engaging activity, we'd also like the activity to highlight/include:
1.        Career Connections – how the activity connects to jobs. 
2.        Role models, we'd also like to feature 1 or 2 role models within that area, focusing on diversity. Often, our events reach into underrepresented communities, and it's important that all children see themselves represented in STEM careers. 
Other details that might be important.
•        We can drop off the materials so you can see exactly what we have in our inventory.
•        Teachers are seeking curriculum that relates to Iowa Core Standards they are already teaching. If possible, it would be great to integrate concepts from Science, Math, or Health.
•        Should you need a content expert, the Hub is happy to connect you with a community resource.
