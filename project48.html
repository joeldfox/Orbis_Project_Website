            <p><b>Information: </b> We would like to create a "recognition board" that would share with the public the great work and achievements of Centennial High School beyond athletics and activities. I have a picture that we are basing this idea off of. This project is being headed by our Jag Culture Team. We have already received permission from Mr. Scott to place the board in a common area at Centennial.
We are seeking help on the design of the board and how to make it visually appealing while being able to adjust information on it from possibly a year to year basis.
We have some ideas of what we would like to include, but we are also open if the students have some other ideas of what should be included.
Please let me know if you would like to see the example picture.
