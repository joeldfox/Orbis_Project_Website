            <p><b>Information: </b> I would like students to come up with a sort of tutorial on a website, google doc, etc that would show students how to use Canvas.  I think this would be great for the students to have access to if they were new to Canvas, or even just forgot how to do something.  Someway for them to have simple instructions with pictures, arrows, descriptions, and even videos of how to turn in an assignment, take a test, see what assignments are missing, message your teacher, use the calendar, would just be a few ideas.
