            <p><b>Information: </b> Create a 'SEED SAVING LIBRARY'  project = Seed of  Resilience   I have visited with Director of Iowa FFA, and they are interested in collaborating.  Veterans in Agriculture is also interested in participating.  Iowa FFA could take this state wide, and nationally.  Seed Savers would provide the seed base - through donation and purchase by Cherry Glen Learning Farm. Seed savers will also guide the project planning, along with Centennial Chad Fickbohm, Cindy Snell FFA,  Ray Meylor at watershed Mitigation Farm.  My long term goal is to also bring in veterans orgs  VFW & American Legion to serve as community anchor groups for Iowa FFA & seed libraries.  Students are invited to contact [ see attachments]  Jeanine Scheffert   Education & Engagement  / Seed Savers Exchange   563-387-5686   jscheffert@seedsavers.org 
</p>
            <p><b>Purpose:</b> Centennial science teacher Chad Fickbohm wants to participate,  and Cherry Glen Learning Farm would host the Centennial  seed saving & seed lending library.  This provides seed sovereignty and food security by increasing local foods and increasing plant biodiversity.   Reduce local food insecurity, create local table food production jobs.
