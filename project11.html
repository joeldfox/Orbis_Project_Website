            <p><b>Information: </b> DMACC needs to "pivot' our career exploration days (Career Discovery Days) to a virtual delivery for the semester. I would like to hear from students what might work and what might not work.  What time of day? How long? What do students want to get out of the experience? 
</p>
            <p><b>Purpose:</b> (CONTINUE THE PROJECT THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN STARTED. Drive folder with resources, etc.)   
GOALS:
Create conversation around mental health, 
Educate, 
Show commonality, 
Destigmatize
DRIVING QUESTION:  How can we use an online course as a tool to better educate, take away stigma and create connections around mental health for high school students?
