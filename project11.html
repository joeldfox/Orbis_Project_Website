            <p><b>Information: </b> In an effort to upgrade our technology/online website/social media offerings to the community, AAHS would request a review of our current uses of technology to promote the AAHS and its products .  Ultimately, suggestions of better uses of and upgrading our technology footprint in the community would be appreciated.
</p>
            <p><b>Purpose:</b> More effectively telling our story will help us connect more with organizations in our community which will hopefully lead to more opportunities to partner with a wider variety of organizations and make the biggest impact we possibly can.  This would also allow us to have a wide variety of project opportunities for innovators to choose from.
It will also help us recruit and promote to future innovators and their parents.
