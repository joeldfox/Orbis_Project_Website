            <p><b>Purpose:</b> During the pandemic, On With Life started offering more online classes. With that, we started sending more e-newsletters. With nearly 4000 people on our mailing list, we want to use the templates as a way to clearly define the type of communication. Additionally this will save our staff time in changing the newsletter each time and will allow for greater consistency and brand awareness.
