            <p><b>Information: </b> We serve youth ages 5-18 six days a week and have little time to properly market the programs the nonprofit youth center offers either in print or online, produce informational safety skills videos for youth, and produce social media content that youth will want to watch regarding social safety, internet safety, avoiding human trafficking, dealing with bullying, empowerment strategies, and self-defense skills. With the director of the youth center being sight  impaired and the House of Rogues Director having severe dyslexia and other language based disorders, these things have been a major challenge It is impairative we accomplish these tasks to let the youth of Ankeny and beyond know the youth center is available to them as a safe place to belong, connect, receive mentorship, get homework help, have fun, and explore new activities while also becoming their best selves.
