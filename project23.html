            <p><b>Information: </b> On With Life sent out more than 130 e-newsletters through Constant Contact last year. This year, with the addition of our new education offering, On With Life Academy, we anticipate it to be closer to 175. We are looking for assistance in creating templates in Constant Contact for the different types of newsletters we send out. This would include, but is not limited to, virtual fitness classes, education events, general e-newsletters, foundation, etc. 
</p>
            <p><b>Purpose:</b> During the pandemic, On With Life started offering more online classes. With that, we started sending more e-newsletters. With nearly 4000 people on our mailing list, we want to use the templates as a way to clearly define the type of communication. Additionally this will save our staff time in changing the newsletter each time and will allow for greater consistency and brand awareness.
