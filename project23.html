            <p><b>Information: </b> I want to improve my business by having our product in big stores and gas stations. I have special products such as sauces and fresh falafel. 
Turn Key Falafel Products 
To Whom It May Concern,
I am Thaer Taha, Owner of Taza Fresh Food Truck.  My falafel entrée placed first prize in 2018 and 2019 Food Truck Throw Down.  I developed the Turn Key Falafel Program as cooking has been my passion and after many years of cooking Middle Eastern Cuisine and specializing in award winning falafel. 
I created the Turn Key Falafel Program because there is a need in the market for a plant based protein entrée. It is healthy, delicious and very popular choice not for just vegetarians but for everyone; especially if prepared fresh and made to order.  Falafel is can be eaten as a snack, side or main course.  The biggest challenge is to make it fresh and the consistency is biggest struggle.  A professional person who is skilled with many years of experience can find this complicated to achieve.  I came up with a simple solution when we witnessed our customer's love for falafel and they are finding it hard to find fresh falafel in the market.  Our customers drive up to an hour just because they can't find it anywhere else.  
What is the Turn Key Falafel Program?
• Process that provides the perfect recipe
• Includes falafel machine, falafel mix and sauces
• Training and support to use machine and how to assemble for presentation
• A full or partial menu option
• Low cost to produce and high profit margin

Adding this to your business is an integral part of the food that people are currently seeking in the marketplace.  You need to be one of the first to provide this quick and easy option in your stores and gas stations.
