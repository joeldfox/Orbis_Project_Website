            <p><b>Information: </b> I am looking for an app to assist with the boxes. Something that lists all the locations, with a one click option to go to google maps, and possibly a way people can “check in” and show if a box is full, empty or half. I’m happy to explain in more detail, or am open to suggestions on what all an app could include.

            <p><b>Purpose:</b> During the pandemic, On With Life started offering more online classes. With that, we started sending more e-newsletters. With nearly 4000 people on our mailing list, we want to use the templates as a way to clearly define the type of communication. Additionally this will save our staff time in changing the newsletter each time and will allow for greater consistency and brand awareness.
