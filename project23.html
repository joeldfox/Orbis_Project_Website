            <p><b>Information: </b> On With Life sent out more than 130 e-newsletters through Constant Contact last year. This year, with the addition of our new education offering, On With Life Academy, we anticipate it to be closer to 175. We are looking for assistance in creating templates in Constant Contact for the different types of newsletters we send out. This would include, but is not limited to, virtual fitness classes, education events, general e-newsletters, foundation, etc. 
</p>
            <p><b>Purpose:</b> ASCD HR is moving forward with an inclusion-based recruiting campaign. We have not done an actual audit of our current materials to get a baseline idea of how well we've done in the past representing diversity and inclusion concepts. We are looking a sharp team of Orbis members to help us understand the  "who and what's missing" in telling our story as we recruit more strategically.
